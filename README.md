# LinkedIn Follower Tracker Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps you track the follower counts of specific LinkedIn profiles over time. You can add profiles directly from their LinkedIn page and view historical follower data on the extension's options page.

## Installation Instructions (for Chrome)

Follow these steps to install the extension:

1.  **Download the Extension:**
    *   Go to the main page of this project on GitHub.
    *   Click the green "<> Code" button.
    *   In the dropdown menu, click "Download ZIP".
    *   Save the ZIP file to a location you can easily find, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

2.  **Unzip the File:**
    *   Find the downloaded ZIP file (it will likely be named `linkedin-follower-tracker-2-main.zip` or similar).
    *   Right-click on the ZIP file.
    *   Select "Extract All..." or "Unzip". If you don't see these options, you might need a tool like 7-Zip (free) or WinRAR.
    *   Choose a destination for the unzipped folder (the same location as the ZIP file is fine). You should now have a regular folder with the extension's files inside.

3.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open your Google Chrome browser.
    *   In the address bar at the top, type `chrome://extensions` and press Enter.
    *   Look for a switch labeled "Developer mode" in the top-right corner of the page and turn it **on**.
    *   You should now see some new buttons appear, including "Load unpacked". Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
    *   A file browser window will open. Navigate to the folder where you *unzipped* the extension files in Step 2.
    *   Select the **entire folder** (the one containing files like `manifest.json`, etc.) and click "Select Folder" or "Open".
    *   The "LinkedIn Follower Tracker" extension should now appear in your list of extensions! You can pin it to your toolbar for easy access by clicking the puzzle piece icon near the top-right of Chrome and then clicking the pin icon next to the extension's name.

That's it! The extension is now installed and ready to use.
